1. Finding out which features are relevant for the prediction task and selecting the top 10 features based on the statistics and visualizations.
2. Training with logistic regression model with L1 regularization and finding the best model using Gridsearch on C values. 
3. Analyzing which features have non-zero coefficients 
4. Here generating polynomial features again using log reg and L1 regularization and checking if the accuracy is increasing this time 
5. Here we are training a decision tree and again checking the accuracy if there is any increase
