#• Finding out which features are relevant for the prediction task and selecting the top 10 features based on the statistics and visualizations.
#• Training with logistic regression model with L1 regularization and finding the best model using Gridsearch on C values. 
#• Analyzing which features have non-zero coefficients 
#• Here generating polynomial features again using log reg and L1 regularization and checking if the accuracy is increasing this time 
#• Here we are training a decision tree and again checking the accuracy if there is any increase
